## Installation Guide
Since D0x-K1t-v2 is self-hosted, it does not work immediately out-of-box. It is recommended that you use a virtualenv container due to the sheer number of dependencies that can run into conflict with your Python configuration.
<br>
<br>
<b>Building</b><br>
```text
$ git clone https://github.com/roo7k1d/D0x-K1t-v2 && cd D0x-K1t-v2
$ # Start virtualenv if you wish
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python run.py
```
<br>
Of course, this is self-hosting on localhost. Although work-in-progress, D0x-K1t-v2 will soon support hosting on a variety of SaaS and server stacks of your choice.

* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - **TODO**: build a `Procfile`, as well as bash scripts for automatic deployment
* [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) - **TODO**: build a script for deployment to ngrok
