# Introduction

### What is this?

D0x-K1t-v2 is an **open-source**, **self-hosted** and **easy to use** OSINT and active reconaissance web application for penetration testers. Based off of the prior command-line script, D0x-K1t-v2 is now fully capable of conducting reconaissance and penetration testing for security researchers who need a framework without the head-scratching.

### Is this a website / webapp?

Yes and no. In essence, it is not a typical website. D0x-K1t-v2 is self-hosted. There is no server stack, cloud-based service, SaaS, etc. that is holding it up. You can have the option of deploying D0x-K1t-v2 on a local network, or deploying your own instance on any infrastructure / technology as you wish \(although not recommended\).

### Is this free?

Yes. D0x-K1t-v2 will forever be open-source. If you wish to contribute, you can make a fork, add any changes, and send a pull request on Github.

### How else can I develop this project?

I have created API endpoints, and more will be coming soon.

### Features

* Easy-to-build, risk-free installation
* Simple Bootstrap Admin Dashboard
* Deployable to the Internet
* Serverless \(at the moment\)
* Expansive to any OS
