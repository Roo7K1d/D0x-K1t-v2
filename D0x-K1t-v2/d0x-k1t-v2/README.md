### 1.0 Introduction

1. **What is this?**

D0x-K1t-v2 is an **open-source**, **self-hosted** and **easy to use** OSINT and active reconaissance web application for penetration testers. Based off of the prior command-line script, D0x-K1t-v2 is now fully capable of conducting reconaissance and penetration testing for security researchers who need a framework without the head-scratching.

1. **Is this a website / webapp ?**

Yes and no. In essence, it is not a typical website. D0x-K1t-v2 is self-hosted. There is no server stack, cloud-based service, SaaS, etc. that is holding it up. You can have the option of deploying D0x-K1t-v2 on a local network, or deploying your own instance on any infrastructure / technology as you wish \(although not recommended\).

1. **Is this free ?**

Yes. D0x-K1t-v2 will forever be open-source. If you wish to contribute, you can make a fork, add any changes, and send a pull request on Github.

1. **How else can I develop on this?**

I have created API endpoints, and more will be coming soon.

### 2.0 Features

* Easy-to-build, risk-free installation
* Simple Bootstrap Admin Dashboard
* Deployable to the Internet
* Serverless \(at the moment\)
* Expansive to any OS

### 3.0 Installation

Since D0x-K1t-v2 is self-hosted, it does not work immediately out-of-box. It is recommended that you use a `virtualenv` container due to the sheer number of dependencies that can run into conflict with your Python configuration.

#### 3.1 Building

**Manual Way:**

```text
$ git clone https://github.com/roo7k1d/D0x-K1t-v2 && cd D0x-K1t-v2
$ # Start virtualenv if you wish
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python run.py
```

#### 3.2 Deployment

Once installed, run with `python run.py`. The application will run a first-time boot, and will then be accessible at `127.0.0.1:5000`.

Of course, this is self-hosting on localhost. Although work-in-progress, D0x-K1t-v2 will soon support hosting on a variety of SaaS and server stacks of your choice.

* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - **TODO**: build a `Procfile`, as well as bash scripts for automatic deployment
* [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) - **TODO**: build a script for deployment to ngrok

### 4.0 Modules

**D0x Module**

The D0x module is a comprehensive info-gathering database that enables the pentester to write "D0x", or a file that holds a collection of data of a certain target, or targets. Using this data, the tester will be able to effectively understand their target, which is a critical point in the attacker's kill chain. D0xing is usually deemed malicious and black-hat in nature. However, with the D0x module, we aim to help security researchers gain momentum when conducting in-the-field pentesting.

The D0x module does come with several features, improved upon based off of the prior revision.

### 5.0 How to Contribute

Contributing is easy! Send a pull request if you feel that anything should be changed, removed, optimized, etc. Issues are also great for reporting bugs.
